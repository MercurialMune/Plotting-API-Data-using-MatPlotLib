# Plotting API Data using Python and Django
A web application that uses a MatPlotLib and Django integration to plot data from a JSON API response. Undoubtedly a small project, yet highly scalable. 

## Specifications
The project was generated via Ona API from Ona Data. The exact API endpont was sourced from [here](https://api.ona.io/api/v1/data/161444). In analyzing and plotting the data, no claim has been made that the statistical logic was flawless in making the conclusions that the graph made. Nevertheless, the graph is a practical and perfect interpretation of the data chosen to represent the entire JSON dataset. That being said, the project has assisted with API data visualization. It is however in a young satge since coming up with the graph was not as automated as the project ultimately aims.

## Prerequisites

    - Python 3.7 
     ***Check the requirements for further prerequisites***

## Set-up and Installation

    - Clone the Repository
    - Install python 3.6
    - Install the requirements by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" from the terminal
    - Run "./start.sh" or "python3 manage.py runserver" from the terminal
    - Uncomment the last line in views 'plt.show' otherwise the code will throw an error if you want to generate your own graph
